# Monarch of Tone — Project Memory

Monarch of Tone is a circuit-level emulation of the Analog Man King of Tone overdrive pedal,
built as an AU/VST3 plugin using JUCE 8+ and chowdsp_wdf Wave Digital Filter modelling.
**Author/Company:** Leigh Pierce

The King of Tone is a **dual-channel** Bluesbreaker-derived overdrive. Both channels are
modelled — 1-to-1 digital clone. Channels run in series and are independently bypassable.
The two channels are named externally by their LED colour: **Yellow** (first) → **Red**
(second). The Theseus Hi-Gain mod is a **fixed** part of the **Red** channel only (not a
runtime toggle); Yellow is always stock.

**Agents:**
- `dsp-validator` — invoke after implementing each DSP stage. Do not proceed to the next
  stage without a PASS verdict.
- `schematic-checker` — invoke for any circuit topology question. Never guess a component
  value or connection from memory.

## Repository State

> **CURRENT: Step 9 — UI complete (engine + full UI done & validated)**

The full audio engine is done & validated (all stages, `MonarchChannel`, `processBlock`,
oversampling — Step 7/8). **The UI is now complete:**
- **Peripheral (shared-look):** `MonarchLookAndFeel` (palette + halo trim knob + main knurled
  knob + OS combo boxes + bypass footswitch + scaling button font), `VUMeter`, `LEDIndicator`,
  Input/Output side panels (trim halo + TRIM + VU), the oversampling strip (LIVE/RENDER combos
  bound to `oversampling_realtime`/`oversampling_render` + UI-size scale button), and a
  resizable/aspect-locked window (base 694×354, 0.5–2.5×) with per-session (APVTS `uiScale`) +
  cross-session (`ApplicationProperties` `defaultScale`) persistence.
- **Pedal face (`PedalFace`):** royal-purple body (`#6A0956`, lit gradient) with gold (`#C6A15B`)
  Papyrus lettering + gold compass rose (ref `pedal_picture.png`). Per channel: Volume/Drive/Tone
  black knurled knobs, a small Presence trim flanking the compass, a 3-way `ClipSwitch`
  (Boost/OD/Dist) at the edge (Red mirrored), an LED, and a bypass footswitch. "MONARCH OF TONE"
  logo (no ANALOG.MAN). Verified by headless render (`UISnapshot` → /tmp/monarch_ui.png) + auval.

**Remaining:** Step 10 final sweep (all controls full-range, no clicks/NaN); ADAA optional.

Build helpers: `Standalone` plugin format (run the UI without a DAW) and the `UISnapshot` console
app (headless editor→PNG; no display needed — `./build/.../UISnapshot [scale]`).

## Build Sequence — Do Not Skip Ahead

1. ✅ **Schematic analysis** — complete. All circuit values verified, MA856 validated, Hi Gain mod characterised.
2. ✅ **JUCE CMake scaffold** — complete. CMakeLists.txt, PluginProcessor, PluginEditor, full
   APVTS parameter layout, MonarchChannel stub, and TaperUtils all in place. AU validated
   with `auval`. (Parameter set later trimmed: the two `hi_gain_*` params were removed when
   Hi Gain became a fixed Red-channel mod — see Step 5 / circuit.md Section 6.)
3. ✅ **chowdsp_wdf smoke test** — complete. `tests/SmokeTest_RC.cpp` implements a 1kHz RC
   lowpass via `chowdsp::wdft` (double precision); measured -3.018 dB at the theoretical
   -3dB corner, confirmed PASS.
4. **Stage-by-stage DSP** ← CURRENT STEP — implement and validate each before moving on:
   - ✅ `Stage1` (IC_A, non-inverting) — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS).** Input
     network (C3/R4/R5 high-pass sub-filter) + root R-type op-amp gain stage (Z_lower =
     (R7+C5)∥(R8+C6), Z_upper = C4∥(R6+DRIVE)). Scattering matrix from `tools/r_solver_sympy.py`
     (validated sympy port of R-Solver) with ideal-op-amp limit. `tests/Stage1_FreqResponse.cpp`:
     peak +12.85 dB @ 4120 Hz (96k), DC shelf −0.20 dB, DRIVE +0.67→+17.60 dB monotonic.
     Accurate at base rate — no oversampling/prewarp needed (an output-reconstruction bug, since
     fixed, had caused a ~−880 Hz error). **Yellow DRIVE floor = 1k** (Theseus stock R2∥R3, a
     nearly-clean min: +0.67 dB at drive 0); matsumin labels R6=10k but we use 1k to err cautious
     / keep Yellow transparent (decision 2026-06-19). Single constant. See `src/dsp/Stage1.h`.
   - ✅ `Stage1` Hi Gain — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS, Step 4b).** Fixed mod on the
     **Red channel only** (decision 2026-06-17), not a runtime toggle. Topology RESOLVED via
     Theseus page-28 hi-res trace: SW1B switches R3(1k) in parallel with the Stage-1 feedback
     floor R2(100k) — i.e. the mod **raises the Z_upper floor resistor**, shifting the DRIVE
     range up ("9 o'clock acts like noon"). Implemented as a single floor-resistance change
     (`Stage1(bool hiGain)`, Red `HiGain_floor=39k` vs Yellow `R6_floor=1k` — the literal Theseus
     100k would be ~+13 dB, far hotter than the documented subtle mod). The R-type matrix
     recomputes live from port impedances, so no solver re-run. `tests/Stage1_HiGain.cpp`:
     hotter everywhere (+10.4→+2.3 dB over Yellow's clean min), monotonic, Red@9:00=13.79 dB ≈
     Yellow@noon=12.80 dB (+0.98 dB). See `src/dsp/Stage1.h`.
   - ✅ `Stage2` (IC_B, inverting) — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS).** Root R-type
     (op-amp VCVS), input C7(100nF)+R9(10k), feedback R10(220k). `tests/Stage2_Gain.cpp`:
     passband 21.90× (−22 target), −3 dB corner 159 Hz exactly, signed gain −21 (inverting).
     Inversion via VCVS terminals (in+=BIAS, in−=pin6−), no PolarityInverterT; output read off
     passive R10 port. SW-1 diodes (R10 ∥ [R11+diodes]) added next. See `src/dsp/Stage2.h`.
   - ✅ `SW1SoftClip` — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS).** ONE `DiodePairT`
     (n_eff=2×n_MA856≈3.024 via the `nDiodes` arg), R11(6.8k) series, R10 parallel.
     Implemented as current-source/diode-root (op-amp virtual ground → known i_in drives
     R10 ∥ [R11+diode], diode = nonlinear root). `tests/SW1SoftClip_Sine.cpp`: small-signal
     −21.5 (inverting), perfectly symmetric, soft knee ≈1.64V (confirms n_eff). See `src/dsp/SW1SoftClip.h`.
   - ✅ `SW2HardClip` — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS).** 1S1588×2 true antiparallel
     (ONE `DiodePairT`, n=1.752), shunt at node_HC via always-present R12=1k. Current-source...
     no — series-R + shunt-diode-root. `tests/SW2HardClip_Sine.cpp`: gain ≈+1, symmetric, HARD
     clamp ±0.55V (rises only to 0.66V @ 10× drive = diode log). See `src/dsp/SW2HardClip.h`.
   - **Run `dsp-validator` after each stage. Do not proceed on FAIL.**
5. **3 clipping modes per channel** — Boost/OD/Dist (`clipping_mode_*`; "Both" dropped 2026-06-19
   for the 3-way hardware toggle). Hi Gain is not a runtime axis (Yellow fixed-standard, Red
   fixed-Hi-Gain), so each channel exposes just its 3 clipping modes (circuit.md Section 18).
6. ✅ **Tone stage** — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS, Step 6).** Passive RC; TONE is
   a 3-terminal pot tap modelled as a 3-port WDF **parallel** adaptor at the wiper (no R-type
   matrix — no op-amp): R_a (series from node_HC source) / R_b+C8 (to BIAS, treble-cut) / R13
   (to node_T_out). node_T_out loaded by Presence (Trim+C9) and the **VOL pot body (100k)**.
   Output = V(node_T_out). `tests/ToneStage_FreqResponse.cpp`: treble-cut control (TONE 1→0
   darkens; 5 kHz −7.6→−27.7 dB), presence lifts hi-cut (5 kHz −18.7→−8.7 dB), passband
   −2.1 dB, DC divider matches to 0.01 dB. See `src/dsp/ToneStage.h`. **Contract:** VolumePot
   must NOT re-load node_T_out with the VOL body (already included here) — only the wiper
   audio-taper tap + C11/R14.
   - ✅ `VolumePot` — **DONE & validated.** VOL 100kA audio-taper wiper tap (scalar; VOL body
     load lives in ToneStage) + C11/R14 output HPF (0.16 Hz, WDF). `tests/VolumePot_Taper.cpp`:
     0/−10/−20/−30/−40 dB exact. See `src/dsp/VolumePot.h`.
   - ✅ `MonarchChannel` full chain — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS, Step 7).** Wires
     Stage1 → Stage2/SW1 → op-amp rail-sat (±3.3 V) → SW2 → Tone → Volume with clipping-mode
     routing. `tests/FullChain_DualChannel.cpp`: all 4 modes both channels, clipping hierarchy
     Boost>OD>Dist>Both, Boost on rails, Red hotter, Yellow→Red series stable, no NaN.
7. ✅ **Oversampling** — **DONE & validated (dsp-validator PASS; auval PASS).** Wraps ONLY each
   channel's nonlinear clip span (`processClip`: Stage2/SW1 + rail-sat + SW2), so the factor
   changes anti-aliasing only — the linear voicing is OS-independent (linear stages prepared once
   at base rate, never re-prepared on factor change). 1x/2x/4x/8x via `oversampling_realtime` /
   `oversampling_render` (isNonRealtime → render); **IIR low-latency live, FIR max-quality
   render**; 2 oversamplers (Yellow, Red), each multi-channel; bypassed channels skip it; latency
   reported. Factor/quality rebuild is on the audio thread, gated to only-on-change (rare). ADAA
   is an optional later refinement.
8. ✅ **Dual-channel integration** — **DONE (audible; auval PASS).** `processBlock` wires
   APVTS → both channels, ±12 dB input/output trim (1 V/FS calibration, `circuitVoltsPerFS`),
   per-channel ~5 ms bypass crossfade, peak meters, and **dual-mono stereo** (a `ChannelStrip`
   {Yellow,Red} per audio channel). Params read once per block via cached APVTS atomic pointers;
   Yellow→Red in series. Oversampling not yet wrapped (Step 7).
9. ✅ **UI implementation** — **DONE.** Shared-look peripheral shell (side panels + OS strip +
   resizable window) and the unique purple/gold `PedalFace` (knobs, 3-way clip switches, presence
   trims, LEDs, footswitches, compass rose, logo). Yellow/Red, no Hi Gain toggle. auval PASS.
10. **Final sweep** — all controls full range, no instability, clicks, or NaN output

## Key Circuit Facts

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Op-amp | JRC4580D per channel (matsumin schematic label JRC4558D is wrong) |
| Stage 1 (IC_A) | Non-inverting — no `PolarityInverterT` |
| Stage 2 (IC_B) | **Inverting** — `PolarityInverterT` required |
| Stage 2 DC gain | –22 (R10=220k feedback / R9=10k input) |
| Stage 2 HPF | 159 Hz (C7=100nF, R9=10k) |
| Soft-clip diodes SW-1 | MA856 ×4 as `[D4+D5]∥[D2+D3]` back-to-back series strings ≡ ONE `DiodePairT` with n_eff=2×1.512≈3.024, Is=7.74e-13; in series with R11=6.8k, branch ∥ R10=220k, gated by SW-1 |
| Hard-clip diodes SW-2 | 1S1588 ×2 true antiparallel pair; one `DiodePairT` shunt at node_HC, fed via R12=1k (always-present Stage 2 output R); Is=2.52e-9, n=1.752 |
| Diode topology | **Symmetric pairs** — `DiodePairT` only, never `DiodeT` |
| Hi Gain | **Fixed mod on the Red channel only** (not a runtime toggle; no `hi_gain_*` param). Yellow always stock. ✅ Implemented & validated (Step 4b): SW1B switches R3(1k) ∥ R2(100k) in the Stage-1 feedback floor → **raises Z_upper floor**, shifting DRIVE range up. Modelled as a single floor-resistance change, `HiGain_floor=39k` (tuned to "9-o'clock≈noon" on the matsumin 10k base; not the old R29∥R8 model). See circuit.md Section 6. |
| Stage 1 feedback | Z_lower=(R7+C5)∥(R8+C6); Z_upper=C4∥(R6+DRIVE 0-100k); Av(s)=1+Zupper/Zlower |
| DRIVE taper | 100kB **linear**; 2-terminal rheostat inside Stage 1 Z_upper only |
| TONE taper | 25kB **linear**; 3-terminal pot tap (R-type adaptor at wiper) — see circuit.md Section 11 |
| VOL taper | 100kA **audio** (`pow(10, 2x-2)`) |
| Presence taper | 50kB **linear**; default fully CCW; 2-terminal rheostat (like DRIVE) from node_T_out |
| Tone stage | Passive RC only — no diodes; 3-terminal TONE pot tap, not two parallel branches |
| Channel routing | Yellow → Red in series; independently bypassable |
| Channel names | Yellow (first, stock) → Red (second, fixed Hi-Gain), after the LED colours |
| Default mode | Overdrive (SW-1 ON, SW-2 OFF) per channel |
| Gain peak | **+12.85 dB @ 4120 Hz (96k, Yellow drive 0.5, floor 1k)**. Accurate at base rate — linear stages need no oversampling/prewarp (earlier large error was an output-recon bug, fixed; see dsp.md). |
| DRIVE floor | Yellow **1k** (Theseus stock R2∥R3, nearly-clean min +0.67 dB); Red **39k** (Hi-Gain, min +11 dB). matsumin labels R6=10k — we use 1k for a cautious/transparent Yellow min. |
| Oversampling live | 1x/2x/4x/8x; default **4x**; bypassed channels skip oversampler |
| Oversampling render | 1x/2x/4x/8x; default **8x**; auto via `isNonRealtime()` |

## Three Most Likely Implementation Mistakes

1. **`DiodeT` instead of `DiodePairT`** — both clipping stages use symmetric matched pairs.
2. **Audio taper on DRIVE or TONE** — both are linear (B-taper). Only VOL is audio taper.
3. **Missing `PolarityInverterT` on Stage 2** — it is inverting; omitting it produces wrong polarity.
